# Basic React Note App

# Description
This is a basic note taking app using React and other dependencies such as ```material ui``` to add libraries and icons, which creates an effecient and simpler application.

Makes use of various concepts to create effecient code such as: 
- complex states
- event handling
- spread operator
- conditional rendering
- React props and usetate hooks 

### Functionalities
To Expand the note form at the top of the page, click on the title input which would then reveal the content textarea as well. 

Create a new note by adding a title and contents in the note form. To add the note, simply click the plus icon at the bottom right. Or clear and close the note taking by clicking the x (close) button. 

For each note, there is a delete icon to remove the note. As well as, there is an edit icon to edit the note and update it by clicking the check-mark button that would appear instead of the plus button.

## Requirements
Node.js is a major requirement to run this application, and it can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Afterwards, simply type ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` in the terminal to install all the dependencies needed to run the program.

Once everything is installed, run ```npm start``` in the terminal to start the program. It should open a new tab on a localhost. However, if not, go to ```http://localhost:3000/``` and it should show the application.

## Workplan ahead/To be implemented
- Allow for different background color per note by user's discretion.
- Allow for bullet points and other rich text features to be added.
